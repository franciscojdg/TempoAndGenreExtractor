# TempoAndGenreExtractor

This repository contains the models developed for my Master Thesis written for the Deep Learning Master I did with *Universidad de Alcal√°*

## Thesis

The aim of this project was to find a good architecture for a neural network that predicts tempo and genre from short music audio clips.

The [thesis](https://github.com/franciscojdg/TempoAndGenreExtractor/blob/master/Master%20Thesis/Memoria_TFM_DeepLearning_FranciscoJDuraGaliana.pdf) is written in Spanish but I will start adding english notebooks to describe the process

## Data

Although many datasets are available only the following were useful for the current problem:
 - FMA: https://github.com/mdeff/fma
 - GTZAN: opihi.cs.uvic.ca/sound/genres.tar.gz
 - hainsworth: http://www.marsyas.info/tempo/ (also contains other useful datasets)
 
 ## Models
 
 The individual models that have been tested, as well as data processing performed, are described in separate jupyter notebooks under [Modelo](https://github.com/franciscojdg/TempoAndGenreExtractor/Modelo)
 
 TO DO: describe models
 
 ## Results
 
TO DO: I will discuss a bit of the results here in the future
 
 ## Bibilography
